# COMP-3300 Final Project: Student Profile Viewer

##  üìå Introduction
This project is a web application designed to display and manage student profiles. It allows users to search, filter, and paginate through student data.

## User Stories S1
Sprint 1 User Stories (Core Profile Display)
- View Student Profiles:

As a recruiter, I want to view a list of student profiles so I can explore potential candidates.

- See Full Profile Details:

As a recruiter, I want to see full details of each student (name, email, degree, GPA, employer, education level, skills) so I can evaluate their qualifications.

- Clean & Readable Layout:

As a user, I want the profile layout to be organized and easy to read so I can quickly scan important information.

- Display All Profiles on Load:

As a user, I want all student profiles to appear automatically when I load the app so I don‚Äôt have to click anything first.

- Basic Search Bar (Initial Setup):

As a recruiter, I want to type a name or keyword into a search bar to check if basic search logic works correctly (initial functionality).

## user stories S2
Sprint 2 User Stories (Filtering, Pagination, Responsiveness)
-Filtering by Degree:

As a recruiter, I want to filter student profiles by degree so I can find candidates with specific academic backgrounds.

-Filtering by Employer:

As a recruiter, I want to filter students by their current or previous employer to identify relevant work experience.

-Filtering by Education Level:

As a recruiter, I want to filter profiles based on education level (e.g., Undergraduate, Graduate) to match my hiring criteria.

-Filtering by GPA:

As a recruiter, I want to view students based on GPA thresholds to focus on high-performing candidates.

-Keyword Search Bar:

As a recruiter, I want to search for students by name, degree, employer, or skills using a search bar so I can quickly locate specific profiles.

-Pagination Controls:

As a user, I want to navigate between pages of results so that I'm not overwhelmed by seeing too many profiles at once.

-Clear Filter Option:

As a recruiter, I want to reset filters easily to go back to viewing all student profiles without refreshing the page.

-Consistent UI Across Devices:

As a user, I want the filtering and pagination interface to be clean and user-friendly so that I can easily interact with the app.

-Mobile Responsiveness:

As a recruiter accessing the app on a mobile device, I want the layout and filters to adjust to my screen size so that I can browse profiles easily on the go.
